# Solana Token Smart Contract

This project is a Solana smart contract written in Rust, implementing a custom token with functionalities such as minting, transferring, and managing ownership. It demonstrates the basics of Solana program development, including account management, error handling, and interaction with the Solana blockchain.

## Features

- **Token Minting**: Authorized accounts can mint new tokens.
- **Transfer**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other accounts.
- **Ownership Management**: The contract owner can transfer ownership to another account.
- **Decimals Management**: The token's decimals can be updated by the owner.
- **Lock Mechanism**: The contract includes a lock mechanism that can restrict token transfers until a specified timestamp.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Rust programming language setup on your machine.
- Solana CLI tools installed.
- An understanding of Solana's programming model and account semantics.

## Installation

1. **Install Rust:**

   Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust on your system.

2. **Install Solana CLI Tools:**

   Visit the [Solana Installation Guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) for detailed instructions on installing the Solana tools.

3. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/solana-token-smart-contract.git
   cd solana-token-smart-contract
   ```

4. **Build the Project:**

   In the project directory, run:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Usage

After installing and building the project, you can deploy the smart contract to the Solana blockchain.

1. **Generate a Solana Key Pair:**

   If you haven't already, generate a new key pair for your Solana wallet:

   ```bash
   solana-keygen new
   ```

2. **Set Solana Cluster:**

   Set the Solana cluster to devnet for testing:

   ```bash
   solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract:**

   Deploy your compiled program to the Solana blockchain:

   ```bash
   solana program deploy /path/to/your/compiled/program.so
   ```

Refer to the Solana documentation for more details on deploying programs.
